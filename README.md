# Bash completion for [Fabric 2](http://fabfile.org)


## Features

Script provides completion for `fab` tasks and long options.

All available tasks are cached in special file to speed up the response. Cache file with tasks updates on every `fabfile` modification.

Long options (like `--help`, `--version` etc.) are cached only when completion is used at first time.

```bash
source /path/to/file/fabric-completion.bash
```

Add `.fab_tasks~` (see below) to your `.gitignore`.

    ```bash
    export FAB_COMPLETION_CACHE_TASKS=false
    ```

    ```bash
    export FAB_COMPLETION_CACHED_TASKS_FILENAME="<cache-file-name>"
